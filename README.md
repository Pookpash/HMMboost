Demonstration of selection probabilities for 30 high-dimensional simulations. As the boosting iteration ($m$) get large, regularization gets weaker, and all covariates have a higher selection probability S (estimated from a bootstrap). Lines in <b>red</b> are truly influential covariates. Lines in <b>gray</b> are non-influential covariates. Lines in <b>pink</b> are not-influential for THETA, but are influential in the other parameter (not THETA). Lines in <b>blue</b> represent the time-as-a-categorical-variable base-learner representing p(t) or phi(t), which in these simulations was non-influential.
